# Robotics-Device-for-Borewell-Rescue-Operation
 1) The Borewell Rescue Robot involves designing a robot capable of  navigating narrow and deep borewells to rescue individuals who  may be trapped
2) The Bore well Rescue Robot is capable of moving inside the well 
and performs operations according to the user commands. 
3) The proposed model is designed to provide the child with two level 
of safety achieved by using robotic holding at the top and safety 
supporting base at the bottom.
 4) The robot is operated by the human manually and monitor in 
computer .According to the observations made continuously using 
CCTV camera.
 5) We are also providing the Oxygen supply through it

 1) Child Rescue:
 These robots are designed to reach the child,       assess 
their condition, and provide necessary assistance until 
they can be safely extracted.
 2)Rescue in Confined Spaces :
 Borewell rescue robots can be used in various confined 
spaces, not just borewells. They are valuable in 
scenarios where humans cannot easily access or where 
it's too risky for rescuers.
 3) Assessment :
 It isequipped with cameras and sensors that allow 
rescue teams to assess the situation underground. This 
helps in making informed decisions and communicating 
with the trapped ones
